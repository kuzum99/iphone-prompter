# iphone-prompter

This utility helps linguists present a list of word to a language consultant, presumably to be recorded.

The iPhone/iPad are ideal for the sound booth environment as they are completely silent. The have no fan, no clicking elements, or anything else that can make noise.

## How to use this utility

* Prepare one or more text files, with every item presented to the consultant in its own line. Put them in the same folder with "index.html".

* Open the "index.html" file with a simple text editor (download a free one if needed, e.g. "TextWrangler" for Mac, or "Notepad++" for Windows).

* In "index.html", find where it says "var files". You will see three files listed there. Specify your file(s) there.

* If you want to, adjust the width and visibility of the progress bar.

* Save and close "index.html".

* Upload the iphone-prompter folder to a webserver (your personal website will come in handy).

* Open Safari on your iphone/ipad, and navigate to wherever you put iphone-prompter.

* Hand the iphone/ipad to your consultant.
