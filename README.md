# iphone-prompter

This utility helps linguists present a list of words to a language consultant, presumably to be recorded.

The iPhone or iPad are ideal for using in the sound booth, as they are completely silent. They have no fan, no clicking mouse or noisy keyboard, or anything else that can make noise.

This utility can also be used on any machine that has a web browser, e.g. your laptop or desktop computer.

## How to use this utility

* Download iphone-prompter (see downloads button above) and unzip the downloaded file. 

* Open a simple text editor (download a free one if needed, e.g. "TextWrangler" for Mac, or "Notepad++" for Windows).

* In your simple text editor, prepare one or more text files, with every item you want to present in its own line. Put the text file(s) in the iphone-prompter folder.

* In your simple text editor, open the "index.html" file.

* In "index.html", go to line 22, where it says "iPrompter.files". You will see three sample files listed there. Specify your own file(s).

* Save and close "index.html".

* Upload the iphone-prompter folder to a web server (your personal website will come in handy).

* Open Safari on your iphone/ipad (or laptop/desktop), and navigate to wherever you put iphone-prompter. The screen will look very big and ugly. Don't worry. Press the + button at the bottom of the screen, and choose "Add to Home Screen". This will add iPrompter as an app on your iphone/ipad. Go to your home screen and open the app.

* Hand the iphone/ipad to your consultant. 

* When you are using iPrompter on a device that has a keyboard, it may be used in addition to the mouse. Your keyboard may be quieter than your mouse.
