# iphone-prompter

This utility helps linguists present a list of words to a language consultant, presumably to be recorded.

The iPhone or iPad are ideal for using in the sound booth, as they are completely silent. They have no fan, no clicking mouse or noisy keyboard, or anything else that can make noise.

This utility can also be used on any machine that has a web browser, e.g. your laptop or desktop computer.

## How to use this utility

* Download iphone-prompter (see downloads button above) and unzip the downloaded file. 

* Open a simple text editor (download a free one if needed, e.g. "TextWrangler" for Mac, or "Notepad++" for Windows).

* In your simple text editor, prepare one or more text files, with every item you want to present in its own line. Put the text file(s) in the iphone-prompter folder.

* In your simple text editor, open the "index.html" file.

* In "index.html", go to line 23, where it says "var files". You will see three sample files listed there. Specify your own file(s).

* If you want to, adjust the width and visibility of the progress bar on line 30.

* Save and close "index.html".

* Upload the iphone-prompter folder to a web server (your personal website will come in handy).

* Open Safari on your iphone/ipad (or laptop/desktop), and navigate to wherever you put iphone-prompter.

* Hand the iphone/ipad to your consultant.
